			Dining Policies
		</h2>
		<p>
			One of our main goals is to provide a pleasant, clean, comfortable and satisfying dining experience. In order to meet this goal, we ask for your assistance with the following procedures:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Please bus your dishes and disposables from your table when you have finished dining</li>
			<li>Please refrain from taking food, dishes or utensils from the dining area.</li>
			<li>Remember that Meal Cards are non-transferable.  Meal cards cannot be used by anyone but the purchaser.</li>
			<li>We are one of the leading college campuses in the country for Sustainability please help us by taking only what you can eat, scraping food waste into our composting bins and recycling any disposables that you may bring in.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>
			Seconds Policy
		</h3>
		<p>You never have to be too shy to ask for seconds with our Campus Dining Program. Our generous policy allows for a second helping of many menu favorites. All you have to do is ask! Please note, however, that there are exceptions to our Seconds Policy including some specialty nights (e.g., Steak Night).</p>
